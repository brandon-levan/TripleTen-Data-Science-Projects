# TripleTen Data Science Projects

## What is TripleTen 
[TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/data-science/) provides an eight-month long, project-based online course that provides rigorous course work and education in machine learning, data exploration, statistical data analysis, python programming, time series forecasting, A/B testing, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. The eight month long program is split into sprints â€“ two- or- three-week-long periods that cover separate technical topics. Each sprint includes theory, coding exercises, and projects where students can apply their skills and create functional applications, services, and features. 

## What Can be Found in This Repository
This repository will host all of my projects that I completed at the end of each sprint. Below, you will find a table of contents that contains a link to each project along with a brief description of the project and skills used to complete the project. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply various methods of exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning to different complex problems across the various sprints.
